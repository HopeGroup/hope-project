     <h1>Birman cat </h1>
     The Birman is a cat of distinction as well as legend. With their exotic ancestry, luxurious pointed coats, “white gloved” paws and mesmerizing blue eyes, this is a breed with undeniable charisma. 


         
          
 <h2>History and Origins</h2>
 The first reports of cats with a genetic mutation causing short legs date back to the 1930s and 40s, but there was no trace of Munchkins throughout World War II. They resurfaced in the 1950s and 70s before being officially established as a breed in 1983.

In 1994, The International Cat Association (TICA) accepted the cat into their new breed development program, and they achieved championship status in 2003. The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) and American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) still do not recognize the Munchkin as a breed
 
 
 <h2>Lifespan</h2>
 <p>
    12 to 15 years
 </p> 
 
 <h2>Colors</h2>
 
 <p> 
    The breed is maintained using an outcross program, which breeds other domestic cats with Munchkins to ensure gene diversity. As a result, these felines can come in an array of different colors and patterns.

  <h2 class="britishCat"> Health </h2>
  Despite its short legs and long back, Munchkin Cats do not have the spinal problems characteristic of dogs with short legs. Although they may not experience back problems, their genetic mutation does increase the risk of other health problems, including osteoarthritis caused by lordosis, or an inward curvature of the spine, and pectus excavatum, or “funnel chest”.
