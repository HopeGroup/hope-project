<h2 class="britishCat">History and Origins</h2>

Country of Origin: Britain
The British Shorthair cat is, by far, the most popular pedigree breed of cat in the UK. 
Although there are only written records for the British Shorthair cat that date back to the beginning of the century, the breed has been in existence for hundreds of years. They were exported in large numbers to the New World where they were very popular. 
The variety of colours and coat patterns available today have come about from the selective breeding of the best street cats during the nineteenth century and continuing careful breeding plans to the present day.
