    <h1>British Shorthair</h1>
    <p> The British Shorthair cat is a largish breed which could be described as chunky or cobby.
         Many of its contours are rounded â€“ face and cheeks, ears, eyes and head. 
         Its short broad nose sits above a deep strong chin and these, along with its deep chest and short, thick tail, all convey a strong and sturdy cat. 
         The coat which is short and dense without being fluffy and comes in over 100 colour and coat pattern combinations.

<h2 class="britishCat">History and Origins</h2>
<p>
Country of Origin: Britain
The British Shorthair cat is, by far, the most popular pedigree breed of cat in the UK. 
Although there are only written records for the British Shorthair cat that date back to the beginning of the century, the breed has been in existence for hundreds of years. They were exported in large numbers to the New World where they were very popular. 
The variety of colours and coat patterns available today have come about from the selective breeding of the best street cats during the nineteenth century and continuing careful breeding plans to the present day.

Although the breed is free from many genetic diseases that plague other breeds, British Shorthairs are susceptible to gingivitis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hemophilia B. Obesity is another concern, as this cat loves to eat and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle.
