<h1>golden Retriever</h1>
<p>
    

    The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. The breedâ€™s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them great family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working dogs.

    Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs.

</p>

  
<h2>History and Origins</h2>
<p>
    For many years, there was a legend that Golden Retrievers were descended from Russian sheepdogs bought from a circus. In fact, the breed was developed in Scotland, at the highland estate of Sir Dudley Majoribanks, later known as Lord Tweedmouth.

 <h2 class=""> Health </h2>

<p>
    Goldens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldens will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.

    The most serious of the potential diseases is cancer. Golden Retrievers are more than twice as likely to get cancer than other breeds.
