    Elegant. Proud. Clever. The Poodle is an impressive dog, as the many best-in-show winners from this dog breed can attest. But behind the blue ribbons, impressive hairdos, and regal attitude, youâ€™ll find an affectionate family dog with an ancient history and many talents.

</p>
<h2>History and Origins</h2>
<p>
    The Poodle is one of the oldest breeds developed especially for hunting waterfowl. Most historians agree that the Poodle originated in Germany, but developed into his own distinct breed in France.

    Many believe that the breed is the result of crosses between several European water dogs, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Hungarian, and Russian water dogs. Other historians think that one of the Poodle's ancestors is the North African Barbet, which was imported to the Iberian Peninsula. After that, the breed arrived in Gaul where it was used for his hunting abilities.

 <h2 class=""> Health </h2>
 <p>
    Poodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.

    If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition
