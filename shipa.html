<h1>shiba-Inu </h1>
<p>
    The Shiba Inu dog breed was originally bred to flush birds and small game, and was occasionally used to hunt wild boar. They’re one of Japan’s six native breeds: Akita (large), Kishu, Hokkaido, Kai, Shikoku (medium), and Shiba (small).

</p>

  
<h2>History and Origins</h2>
<p>
    The Shiba Inu originated in Japan along with the Akita, Shikoku, Kai Dog, Hokkaido and Kishu, all of which are larger than the Shiba Inu. The Shiba Inu was used primarily as a hunting dog to flush out small game and birds for hunters.

There are several theories how the Shiba Inu got his name. One explanation is that the word Shiba means "brushwood;" the dogs were named for the brushwood bushes in which they hunted. Another theory is that the fiery red color of the Shiba is the same as the autumn color of the brushwood leaves. A third idea is that an archaic meaning of the word shiba refers to his small size.

 <h2 class=""> Health </h2>
 <p>
    Shiba Inus are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Shiba Inus will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.
