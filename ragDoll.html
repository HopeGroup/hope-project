<h1> Rag doll </h1>
<p>
    Ragdolls are loving, smart and playful. They show affection to their people by greeting them, following them around, sitting in their laps and snuggling in bed. Ragdoll cats can also learn tricks and certain behaviors with positive reinforcement. </p>

  
<h2>History and Origins</h2>
<p>
    Ann Baker, a breeder in California, developed the breed in the early 1960s using free-roaming cats she found in her neighborhood. As time went on, she grew eccentric and other breeders broke distanced themselves to maintain the integrity of the breed.

    In 1993, the breed was registered with the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA), receiving full recognition in 2000. The American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA) also recognized the breed.

<h2>Colors</h2>

<p> 
    With point coloring similar to the Himalayan or Siamese breed, Ragdolls have light-colored bodies with darker extremities. With a color palette ranging from seal to blue to chocolate to cinnamon and more, the combinations of colors and patterns are almost endless. Ragdolls also have distinct blue eyes.

 <h2 class=""> Health </h2>
 <p>
    Although DNA tests exist to help breeders weed out certain health problems, some complications may still arise for a Ragdoll. She may develop bladder stones or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease. Ragdolls also have a predisposition for feline infectious peritonitis.
