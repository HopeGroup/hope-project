<h1>siberian husky </h1>
<p>
   
Siberian Huskies have captured the imagination of the masses, as well as artists, writers, and film producers, with their eye-catching looks and awe-inspiring talents. 
</p>

  
<h2>History and Origins</h2>
<p>
    The Siberian Husky is believed to have originated among the Chukchi, a tribe of Siberian nomads. The breed's history is relatively unknown but DNA tests confirm that they are among the oldest of dog breeds. We do know that the Chukchi used the dogs as fast transportation and that they interacted with the Chukchi as a family dog. Huskies often slept with the children and provided warm comfortable beds for them.

    11-14 years
  

</p> 


 <h2 class=""> Health </h2>
 <p>
    Huskies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Huskies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.

If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.
